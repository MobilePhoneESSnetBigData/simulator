<b> Framework to run mobile network data micro-simulations </b>
<p>
<p>!!! Warning !!!</p>
This project is in early stages of development. 
Major code revisions are expected to occur without notice and on a daily basis.

The project implements a "development of a framework to run mobile network data micro-simulations. 
These simulations will provide us with synthetic data, useful to test the models. 
Being a micro-simulation, the estimations can be compared to the real data, unavailable in real life. 
While a simulation is (no matter how sophisticated) always diï¬€erent from real data, 
there is really no reason to expect that a model would perform worse for synthetic data than for real data. 
On the contrary, dealing with real data would be expected to be even more problematic, 
so a good performance for simulated data should be demanded anyway." <a href = "https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/essnetbigdata/images/5/56/WPI_A_framework_for_mobile_network_data_micro-simulation_2019_02_14.pdf">(Salgado, D. et al. 2018) <>
