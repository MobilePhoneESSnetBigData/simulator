Here are some simple commands to run the docker image of the mobile network simulation software.
If you work under Windows, simply replace CURRENT_DIR variable with the current working directory. Under a Unix-like OS the name of the working directory
can be obtained with the command below.
In the working directory you should have all the input configuration files: simulation.xml, persons.xml, antennas.xml, probabilities.xml and map.wkt. The output files are also 
saved in the working directory.

To run a simulation, open a terminal and run the following commands:

$CURRENT_DIR=`pwd`
$docker load -i simulator.tar
$docker run  --rm -v $CURRENT_DIR:/repo -t -i simulator -m map.wkt -s simulation.xml -p persons.xml -a antennas.xml -v -o -pb probabilities.xml


If you want to build your own docker image we provide here a Dockerfile and the Linux executable. The image can be built with the following command:

$docker build -t=simulator .
